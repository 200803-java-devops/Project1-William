<h1>Application Logger</h1>
The end-goal for this project will be an application accessible via server that will be able to access our Project0s on Github, download and run them, and automatically log communication data between the client and server.  I reserve the right to change the scope and direction of this project in order to make it more robust or larger in scope.

<h1>User Stories<h1>

<ul>
  <li>The user will be able to access projects and select one to run</li>

  <li>The user will be able to run one of said projects from the application (Double check to ensure this will be possible or not out of scope)</li>

  <li>The user will be able to view logs made by the application concerning data and communication (exact type of information logged is TBA) between the client and the application, which can potentially aid a developer during testing</li>

<li>The user will be able to sort through these logs from the application</li>
</ul>
